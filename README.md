Key Insights:
TIER 1 has the lowest financial responsibility, both for leads and sales, indicating better insurance or lower out-of-pocket costs.
TIER 2 shows a high decrease in responsibility from leads to sales, suggesting financial barriers prevent some leads from converting.
TIER 3 has the highest responsibility for leads, but lower for sales, likely due to financial assistance or coverage after conversion.

**Key Takeaways & Recommendations:**
Focus on older demographics (61+) for Sleep Apnea testing, as they show strong conversion rates, but consider increasing awareness and education for younger groups.
BCBS is a reliable source, but there is potential for Self Pay and Medicare to contribute more to sales. Consider exploring partnerships or financial support for these groups.
TIER 1 should continue to be prioritized due to its high conversion rate, but more effort is needed to reduce financial barriers in TIER 2 and TIER 3 to increase conversions.
Offering financial assistance programs or flexible payment options, especially for TIER 3, could significantly improve conversions from high-value leads.
